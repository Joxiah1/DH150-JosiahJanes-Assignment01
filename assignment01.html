[Project Description and Purpose]
In this project, we will be testing and examining how to improve the
web-accessibility and search engine optimization of various websites.
Accessibility and SEO are integral parts of the functionality of a website.
A website with a lack of accessibility can quickly alienate its users by being
hard to navigate or understand.

With this in mind, web developers must balance
the scope of their project's ambitions with the usability of their website. This
notion of accessibility not only concerns the average user of the site, but also
extends to users that may have certain disabilities such as blindness, deafness,
a lack of motor skills, etc. On the other hand, web developers must also look to
prioritize their website's search engine optimization so as to ensure that their
users can easily find their website on popular search engines.

By examining various websites' accessibility and search engine optimization, we
can further understand where some sites excel in their web design and functionality
and where others may fail. In doing so, we will be able to better design our own
websites with these considerations in mind.

[Research]
To learn more about the importance of web-accessibility and search engine
optimization, I chose to research my five favorite museums' websites.
I performed a test or "audit" of these websites' web-accessibility and SEO
by using Google Chrome's built in developer tools. More specifically, I used
Google Chrome's Lighthouse auditing software to automatically generate reports on
these websites.

Upon generating a report for a webpage, the Lighthouse auditing
software will return back a score or grade for that site's accessibility and SEO.
These scores are graded on a 1-100 scale and can be used to further understand
where web developers can improve a site's design for ease of use as well as
improving the site's search ranking on search engines.

1) Met Museum Learning Resources, https://www.metmuseum.org/learn/learning-resources, Accessibility Score (91), SEO Score (92)
2) Lyon Air Museum Airplane Exhibit, https://www.lyonairmuseum.org/exhibits/airplanes, Accessibility Score (99), SEO Score (75)
3) Museum of Modern Art Groups and Tours, https://www.moma.org/visit/groups, Accessibility Score (98), SEO Score (82)
4) Marconi Automotive Museum Collection, https://www.marconimuseum.org/automotive-museum, Accessibility Score (78), SEO Score (92)
5) National Atomic Testing Museum Permanent Exhibits, https://www.nationalatomictestingmuseum.org/exhibits/permanent-exhibits, Accessibility Score (90), SEO Score (67)

[Findings]
The average accessibility score among these five websites is 91.2, and the average SEO score is 81.6.
Immediately, we can see that these websites' accessibility scores fare quite well
whereas their SEO scores are compartively lower and would benefit from a more
optimized design.

In looking more specifically at these websites' accessibility issues, I found that
image elements lacking alt attributes was an extremely common problem. From my
research, this means that some of the images on these websites lacked short,
descriptive, alternate text that would make the site more accessible for some
users. Moving forward, I also noticed that these sites' accessibility suffered
from their heading elements not being in a sequentially descending order. From
what I understand, this means that these sites' headings are more difficult to
navigate with screen reader software. Finally, the third most common accessibility
issue that I observed was that some of the sites background and foreground colors
do not have a sufficient contrast ratio. A sufficient contrast ratio is important
as it can be hard for some users that have some forms of blindness to distinguish
such background and foreground text.

In examining these websites' SEO issues, I found that many of these sites' links
lacked descriptive text and crawlability. From what I understand, search engines
will rank sites more highly in search rankings if it is able to "crawl", access,
and understand all of the information that is presented on a website. If websites
lack these critical characteristics, they will experience lower search rankings
and thus website traffic. Another common issue I found on these websites was
that some of these sites lacked a meta description. In a similar vein, a
meta description also helps search engines to process and understand a website
based on a brief summary of the contents of the page. This summary further allows
both users and automatic search ranking algorithms to determine the usefulness
of a website.

Admittedly, while some of these errors may have confused me at first, I am
further aware of how simple some of these accessibility and SEO issues are to
solve and am excited to see how this newfound knowledge will assist me in the
rest of this course and beyond.
