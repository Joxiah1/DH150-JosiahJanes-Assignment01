      muscle cars. The open wheel car collection features cars driven by Founder
      Dick Marconi, his son John, and wife Bo. Additionally, there are many famous
      cars driven by famous drivers. A collection you won't want to miss. <br>

      <h3> Dick and John Marconi donated their car collection and the building that
      housed it to found the Marconi Automotive Museum & Foundation for Kids in 1994.
      We were voted SoCal's favorite museum! </h3>
      After Dick had achieved success both personally and professionally, he wanted
      to give back to the community that helped build him. Creating the Foundation
      was the last chapter in his life mantra, "laern, earn, and return." The museum
      continues to raise money for at-risk children's charities throughout Orange
      County from visitors touring the collection and booked events. <br>

      "Great museum for the whole family of all ages. This museum has such an impressive
      variety of classic, exotic and rare car collections. It's amazing to know
      that one man became very successful and collected all these fabulous cars
      and are now beautifully displayed for all to see. The best part proceeds go
      to a children's foundation." - Janet R. <br>
